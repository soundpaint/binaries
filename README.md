# Precompiled Binaries

This repository contains a collection of precompiled binaries from my
other repositories, such as software packages, but also generated
documentation like PDF presentation slides from LaTeX or other source,
that I also may link to from other sites.  I will eventually update
the binaries.  However, for getting the latest (source) code, you
really should go immediately to the according repository and fetch the
code directly from there.
